# Notes

## Plan Stream (07-08-2025)

- [x] report issue with gleam code action "generate function" for wisp websocket handlers (`websocket` instead of `mist`)
- [x] decide on api how a finished workflow in spider would look like. does each actor spawn a web socket? do we have one server that actors communicate with?
- [x] setup a server w/ ws
- [x] setup communication between ws and browser extension

## Plan Stream (14-08-2025)
- [ ] figure out bidirectional communication. not just browser extension ws -> server

## Backlog
- [ ] launch browser functionality
- [ ] reduce chrome ffi to what we really need
- [ ] come up with plan for testing & iterating
