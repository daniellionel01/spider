# Issues & Open Questions

* how do we publish this package with the browser extension? how does the browser load the browser extension if not with a local path?
* how do we do integration & automated testing? is this feasable in a github action (like in https://github.com/JonasGruenwald/chrobot?tab=readme-ov-file#github-actions)
