- [Core](./spider_core/README.md) - Shared application logic between packages.
- [Browser Extension](./spider_extension/README.md) - Executes the actions sent to the server in the browser.
- [Server](./spider_server/README.md) - Manages the browser instance & provides an API to receive actions to perform in the browser.
- [Admin Panel](./spider_admin/README.md) - Web UI to manage & control multiple spider servers & browsers.
- [Bot Detection Tests](./spider_bot_detection/README.md) - Test various bot detectors to avoid captchas and account bans.
