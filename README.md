</p>

## Packages

- [Spider JS](./spider_js/README.md) - Pure JavaScript utility functions & API wrappers for Gleam.
- [Core](./spider_core/README.md) - Shared application logic between packages.
- [Browser Extension](./spider_extension/README.md) - Executes the actions sent to the server in the browser.
- [Server](./spider_server/README.md) - Manages the browser instance & provides an API to receive actions to perform in the browser.

## How it works

TODO

## Additional Resources

- TODO: Bot evasion report
- TODO: Stress test report on cpu, memory usage. How much can you handle with a VPS of size X?

## Future Work

- [Bot Detection Tests](./spider_bot_detection/README.md) - Test various bot detectors to avoid captchas and account bans.
- [Large Action Model](./spider_lam/README.md) - Give LLMs controller over the browser for self-healing workflows.
